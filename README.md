# FullStack-Developer-Test

Here is my simple GraphQL API that should allow clients to perform CRUD operations on a task resource.  
I implemented resolvers because i wanted to test it on the GraphiQL UI.  
I used "express" and "express-graphql" libraries because i found them pretty cool to use.  
It was a first time for me so i learned a lot for this test.
